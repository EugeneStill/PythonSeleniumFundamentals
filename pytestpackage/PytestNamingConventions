PyTest	Naming	Conventions
http://pytest.readthedocs.io/en/reorganize-docs/newdocs/user/naming_conventions.html
When	using	pytest,	it	is	very	important	to	follow	naming	conventions.
If	we	don't	follow	naming	conventions,	then	pytest	will	not	pick	up	tests	from	the	file.

• File	names	should	start	or	end	with	“test”,	as	in	test_example.py	or	example_test.py
• Class	name	should	start	with	“Test”,	as	in	TestExample
• Test	method	names	should	start	with	“test_”,	as	in	test_example

PyTest Fixtures
http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html
After pytest version 2.10, you do not need @pytest.yield_fixture explicitly to use yield.

The default @pytest.fixture also supports yield.

It means the code will work if you are using @pytest.yield_fixture or @pytest.fixture.
