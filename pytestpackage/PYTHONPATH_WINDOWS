In PyCharm I avoided issues with PYTHONPATH by setting the sources root folder.
Right-click on project->Mark Directory As->Sources Root
This makes the project folder the root folder for the project

"export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:."

This command is only needed for Mac system.

If you are working on Windows, you can use this command:

    set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\Complete path of the directory from where you are running the code

If the above does not work, please try these also:
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%:.
set PYTHONPATH=../

Alternatively, you can do this:

You can add the directory where your project is located to the Windows PATH environment variable.

You can follow the steps shown in lecture "Selenium WebDriver 3.x Gecko Driver Setup - Windows"
to see how we add a new path to PATH environment variable.
